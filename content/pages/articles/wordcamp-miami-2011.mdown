Summary: Follow-up on my talk this morning.

# WordCamp Miami 2011

<img src="/attachments/WCMIA2011Welcome.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft" /> Thanks to everyone who was able to attend my presentation this morning
on responsive web design. Here's a set of links and resources for
responsive web design, feature detection, and CSS3:

-   My slides from this morning on [SlideShare][]. There are links in
    the presentation to statistics and more.
-   [Modernizr.js][], for detecting what features a browser supports.
    Custom-build your own Modernizr with only the tests you need to make
    it even more lightweight.
-   [Yepnope.js][] for conditional loading of CSS/JavaScript. Note: This
    is already bundled in to Modernizr - just use "Modernizr.load()" in
    your JavaScript instead of "yepnope()".
-   A nice overview of [CSS3 transforms][].
-   A great look at [CSS3 transforms, transitions, and animations][],
    with some great demos.

Here's also a list of people to look into:

-   Ethan Marcotte, author of the original "Responsive Web Design"
    article for [A List Apart][]. Check him out on Twitter ([@beep][])
    or his blog, [Unstoppable Robot Ninja][].
-   Luke Wroblewski, originator of "Mobile First". On Twitter he's
    [@lukew][], and his site is [lukew.com][].
-   Jeremy Keith, author of "HTML5 for Web Designers" and responsive web
    advocate. See [@adactio][] or [adactio.com][].
-   Bryan Rieger, whose presentations on the mobile web originally
    inspired me to do all this work. Check out his site at
    [yiibu.com][], and especially check out his presentation
    "[Rethinking the Mobile Web][]".

#### But wait! There's more!

For even more links, see my previous post, "[WordCamp Miami 2011 Sneak
Preview][]". Again, thanks if you were able to make it to my
presentation, and please read through at least a few of these articles!
Mobile (in all shapes and sizes) is at the tipping point, and even if
you have no interest in mobile, responsive design can have real effects
on your user interface and overall design.
