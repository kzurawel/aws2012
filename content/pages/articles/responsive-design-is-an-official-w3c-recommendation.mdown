Summary: More than just a passing fad, responsive design is here to stay.

# Responsive Design is an Official W3C Recommendation

<img src="/attachments/w3c.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft" /> The [W3C][] (World Wide Web Consortium) is like the United Nations of
web development: a consortium of browser makers and interested parties
that generates recommendations and resolutions. Also like the United
Nations, the W3C's resolutions and recommendations have no legal power
and only take effect when browser makers (and designers and developers
in general) implement them of their own free will. The process of going
from idea to official recommendation is fraught with bureaucracy, and
the W3C has [frequently][] [been][] [criticized][] for its glacial pace.

Surprisingly, however, the W3C is ahead of the curve when it comes to
mobile web design. In July 2008, the W3C published its "[Mobile Web Best
Practices][]" as an official W3C Recommendation. The document describes
many of the same concerns that responsive design and Mobile First
advocates have been touting recently - the challenges of smaller
screens, more limited input, and costly and limited bandwidth. 

But the
most interesting part of the document is section 3.1, "[One Web][]". In
this section, the W3C officially endorses the principles of responsive
web design by stating that designers should work toward the principle of
"One Web". According to the W3C, this means "making, as far as is
reasonable, the same information and services available to users
irrespective of the device they are using" - the same belief that
underlies responsive web design! 

Going even further, the W3C recommends
that designers prepare for screen widths of **120 pixels** and total page
weight of no more than **20KB** as a "default delivery context," not to
mention "no support for client side scripting" - no JavaScript, at all.
These are difficult targets to reach in practice, but they underscore
the idea that content and context can be worth far more than an
attractive but limited layout. Meeting these goals in a "mobile"
representation of your site lays a solid groundwork on which to build
with progressive enhancement through media queries. 

The remainder of the
document is a list of best practices with examples and explanations, but
to call these simply "Mobile Web" best practices is a bit of a misnomer.
**These principles can (and in fact should) be applied to any website's
design**. There isn't a single site on the Web that couldn't benefit
from looking at the balance of number of links on a page vs. number of
clicks required to get to a page, or ensuring that information conveyed
through color is also discernible without the use of color. 

So, believe
it or not, 2008 was a pivotal year for mobile web standards. If you're
designing a website (or if you own a website), you owe it to yourself to
read through the W3C's Mobile Web Best Practices. Even if you don't
expect mobile users at your site, taking these suggestions to heart will
result in a better experience for *all* of your users, in the spirit of
One Web.
