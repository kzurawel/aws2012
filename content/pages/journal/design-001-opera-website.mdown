Summary: My first entry in "104 Designs for 2010."

# Design 001: Opera Website

![image][] As the first full week of 2010 comes to a close, I have
one new design to add to my portfolio. I set two new designs per week as
my New Years' resolution for this year, and I plan to fulfill my
original goal of 104 new designs this year even if I don't strictly
stick to the 2-per-week scheme. 

On to the design itself. For my first
design, I re-did the website for the Florida Grand Opera. The original
FGO site was quite good, but it didn't do much to inform interested
ticket buyers about what was currently being performed or how to buy
tickets. My re-worked design moves the side navigation to a horizontal
bar across the top of the site, using the freed-up space to display news
items instead and leaving the main content area for displaying
information about the currently-scheduled performance. Click the image
to interact with the new design; you can also see the [original site][].

Is this design perfect? Hardly. There are a large number of items from
the original site that I left out in creating this new design which
would have to be added back - sponsor logos across the bottom, links to
Facebook and other social media sites, and the PDF brochure (which,
compared to the original website, is simply stunning - I was very
surprised that more of the PDF's assets were not used to create their
website). But for a week of on-and-off effort, I'm pleased with the
result. 

I'm also launching a new subdomain to host all of the designs to
come this year: [portfolio.arborwebsolutions.com][]. Each design will be
available in a numbered subdirectory; you can find the current design
under "001". Thanks for reading, and I'll be back again in
a few days with my next design.
