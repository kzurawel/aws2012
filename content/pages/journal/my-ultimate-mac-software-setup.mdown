Summary: The tools I use to do what it is that I do.

# My Ultimate Mac Software Setup

<img src="/attachments/macapps.jpg" alt="Mac apps" class="alignleft" /> I got my first Mac, a unibody 13" Macbook (aluminum, just
before they became Macbook Pros), a little over a year ago. In that
time, I've fallen in love with the quality of the hardware, the
usefulness of Mac OS X, and - especially - the software available for
the platform. In this post I'll show you the software that I've come to
rely on in my daily work.

1.  [Espresso][] - I picked up a copy of this program as part of the
    MacHeist bundle. It's an IDE for web design, handling HTML/CSS
    editing (with autocompletion), a built-in WebKit browser for
    previews as you work, FTP syncing, and project organization. Plugins
    called "sugars" even let you extend Espresso's support for other
    languages. If they added preview support for PHP, it would be even
    better, but as is it's still hard to beat for productivity.
2.  Mail.app / iCal / Address Book - The Mac OS dream team. Newer
    versions of Mail.app finally have solid support for Gmail over IMAP,
    and it integrates smoothly with iCal and Address Book for managing
    tasks, appointments, and contacts. Together they do everything I
    might use a more heavyweight program or webapp for.
3.  [Photoshop CS4][] - Some designers prefer to use Fireworks for
    creating site mockups and graphical elements, but Photoshop is the
    tool I turn to again and again. I usually start by creating a mockup
    in Photoshop, and then slicing out discrete graphical elements,
    tiling backgrounds, and gradient fills for use in Espresso.
4.  [NetNewsWire][] - This program quickly became my RSS feed reader of
    choice. It syncs with my Google Reader account, and it has fast and
    intuitive keyboard controls that let me get through mountains of
    news in a fraction of the time it would take with even Google
    Reader's webapp.
5.  [TweetDeck][] - If you're a Twitter power user, you will use this
    program. End of story.
6.  [iTerm][] - A fast and flexible replacement for the built-in
    Terminal.app, iTerm supports tabbed terminal windows, a fullscreen
    mode, and keyboard shortcuts for switching between tabs, letting you
    turn your Mac into something much closer to bare Unix when you need
    to work with a remote server, without having to boot a Linux virtual
    machine.
7.  [WriteRoom][] - A distraction-free writing environment, WriteRoom
    hides all of the clutter of your computer and lets you focus on
    writing - without even having to worry about formatting. Great for
    when you just want to get words out and edit them later.
8.  [Klok][] - This program isn't perfect, but it's still the best
    time-tracking program I've ever used. Set up projects and then click
    a button to start tracking time for that project; click again to
    stop. Klok will then automatically make weekly and monthly
    timesheets for you, along with pie charts showing you the ratio of
    time spent on your various projects. Having all of this work done
    for you makes invoicing a snap.

These eight programs are far from the only software I use on my Mac, but
I'd consider them the "must-have" list that I would rush to install on a
new computer. What software can you not live without? Whether Windows,
Mac, or Linux, leave your own list in the comments below; I'll make a
round-up of crowd favorites in a later post. *Photo by
