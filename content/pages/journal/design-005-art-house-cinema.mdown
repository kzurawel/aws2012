# Design 005: Art House Cinema

![image][] Today, I present Design 005, a re-imagining of the [Miami
Beach Cinematheque][]'s website. The MBC currently has a Flash-powered
website that also links in a boilerplate ticket ordering site from
Tix.com. I liked the style of the existing site, but the use of Flash
didn't add anything to the site, while simultaneously making the site
harder to update and totally unusable on the iPhone. 

So, I sought to
re-work the site's overall feel using only CSS3 and JavaScript, while
updating the layout to entice new visitors. The site's title in the
upper-left is positioned using CSS3 Transforms, rotating the headers -5
degrees and giving them 20 pixels of top margin to keep them legible.
This solution degrades nicely in browsers that don't support (all of)
CSS3, appearing as standard, horizontal headers. The headers are also
given a transparent background with RGBA color. The site uses the
excellent Museo font for its headers thanks to Cuf√≥n. The site
navigation in the upper right has rounded corners thanks to
border-radius, and the same transparent background as the headers. 

The
current film section is set to a fixed height with overflow: auto to get
vertical scrolling. I chose this setup because it allows visitors not as
interested in the current film to see that there is additional content
underneath without scrolling, while allowing interested readers to learn
more about the film without clicking to a new page. Upcoming films are
presented with their film posters and the dates of their showings below
the current film. The background image for the site comes from the 1923
Harold Lloyd film "[Safety Last!][]", chosen because I feel it evokes a
sense of whimsy and a connection to film history. The original image
from the film was given a color overlay layer and some artistic filters
in Photoshop to help it blend into the background. 

Only 99 designs left
to go for the year. Next, I'll be taking a look at the world of online
magazines.
