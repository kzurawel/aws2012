# Villa Leonie

This vacation resort in Guadeloupe, an overseas region of France located
in the Caribbean, needed a new look to showcase its luxury
accommodations to French vacationers. The site's design was completed by
[Shinevine][], and Arbor Web Solutions then constructed a live site from
Shinevine's design. This site features revolving imagery in the header
and large graphics to catch the viewer's eye and help them imagine their
dream island vacation.
