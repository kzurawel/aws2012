# Westlake Plastic Surgery

Dr. Robert Caridi of Westlake Plastic Surgery had a vast amount of
content (nearly 100 pages), but his site's design was seriously
outdated. The designers at [Logic By Design][] created a striking,
modern design. Arbor Web Solutions then built a functioning site from
LBD's graphic design work and migrated all of Dr. Caridi's content. The
live site includes jQuery features like a scrolling sidebar and image
carousel, as well as backend features that let the staff at Westlake
Plastic Surgery update their complicated home page easily.
