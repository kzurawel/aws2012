# 002: Psychologist Website

Today I’d like to present design number 2 of my 2010 New Year’s
resolution, a few days after my rework of the Florida Grand Opera’s
website. This time, I’ve created a site for a psychologist –
specifically, Ivan Pavlov working under an assumed name (the photo of
him is from Psychology Pictures, under a CC-BY 2.0 license). What’s most
interesting about this design is the underlying techniques. This is the
first site I’ve built using HTML5. The site uses HTML5′s simplified
doctype; new semantic elements like `hgroup`, `nav`, and `footer`; and CSS3 styles like
border-radius, box-shadow, and text-shadow. As usual, I used Cufón for
font replacement in the navigation section and the header at the top of
the page. The design seeks to be light but professional, with a color
scheme that fits with South Florida. I also wrote the site’s copy, which
is based on an amalgamation of other psychologist websites.
